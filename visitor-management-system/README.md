# Visitor Management System

## Project Overview 

The Visitor Management System (VMS) is a decentralized application, built on the ICP blockchain, that utilizes facial recognition for secure and efficient visitor management. Designed for both businesses and organizations, this VMS allows seamless check-in and check-out experiences without the need for traditional paperwork or badges.

In this system, visitors are verified via their facial recognition data captured through device cameras (phone or computer), which is then matched against stored profiles. The ICP blockchain provides a secure, decentralized way of managing visitor data, ensuring privacy and transparency while maintaining accurate visitor logs.

## Use Cases

1. **For Hosts**: Property managers, security personnel, and receptionists can verify and log visitor check-ins in a secure manner, traceable on the blockchain.
2. **For Visitors**: Fast and contactless check-ins that eliminate the need for physical IDs or repeated data entries on return visits.

## Key Features

- **Blockchain Security**: Visitor data and logs are securely stored on the ICP blockchain, ensuring tamper-proof records.
- **Facial Recognition**: Real-time face matching using Azure’s Face API allows quick check-ins and out, only requiring a device camera.
- **Privacy-Centric**: The decentralized storage model ensures that sensitive data is accessible only to authorized users.
- **Transparency and Traceability**: All visitor logs are traceable and immutable, providing a reliable audit trail.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Motoko

## AI Integration

The system will integrate an anomaly detection AI algorithm for an added layer of security to the system. The algorithm will track activity patterns, such as unusual visitor check-in frequencies or abnormal behaviors over time.

## Why the ICP Blockchain?

- **Decentralized Data Storage**: Unlike traditional centralized VMS solutions, ICP allows visitor data to be stored on a decentralized network, making it more secure and resistant to tampering.

- **Enhanced Privacy and Security**: By using ICP, we can store sensitive visitor information on-chain, with cryptographic guarantees that only authorized users can access the data.

- **Scalability and Cost Effectiveness**: ICP's blockchain architecture is designed for high scalability, meaning it can handle large volumes of data and user interactions, essential for applications that may need to manage thousands of visitors.

- **Smart Contracts for Immutable Logs**: ICP’s smart contracts allow for transparent, unalterable logs of visitor check-ins and check-outs, providing a reliable audit trail without centralized oversight.
